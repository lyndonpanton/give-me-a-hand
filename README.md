# give-me-a-hand
Marked Pogramming Assignment 3 for the "More C# Programming and Unity" course of the "C# Programming for Unity Game Development" Specialization by the University of Colorado via Coursera

## Description

Assignment Description

Now that you’ve learned about Lists, you realize that you could use a List to hold a hand of cards. Once you have the cards in your hand, you could look at them to count how many cards you have of each suit.

In this assignment, you'll read in how many cards should be in the hand, add that many cards to a List (by calling the GetCard method I provided), process the List to determine how many cards of each suit you have, then print out that information.

Requirements

The code I’ve provided reads in the number of cards to put in the hand and stores it in a numCards variable. Your code must call the GetCard method the appropriate number of times and store the Card the method returns in a List variable. Once you’ve added the appropriate number of cards the List, you need to count how many cards of each suit are in the List and print that result.

You can read the documentation for the classes included in the ConsoleCards dll by double-clicking the index file in the Help folder in the extracted location for the zip file. Do NOT try to open the index file from within the zip file.

Your solution must do the following:

·        Store the cards in a List

·        Count the number of cards you have of each suit

·        Print the counts of each suit as described below

For example, if you have 1 club, 1 diamond, 0 hearts, and 3 spades in the array, your output should be the following on a single line (be sure to include a newline at the end):

C1 D1 H0 S3

We’d typically label our output to tell the user what the output means, but that will just confuse the automated grader. You must print ONLY the values described above in your output, with the values appearing on a single line with a single space between them.
